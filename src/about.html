            This planner allows you to schedule tasks and manage your time efficiently.
            It is a system that basically makes you separate all your activities into four priority levels, one of which
            (Not Important/Not Urgent) is immediately dropped, so really it’s only three categories of attention-worthy
            tasks to focus on.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>'Important' and 'Urgent' tasks. These receive the highest priority level and should be your primary
                focus to complete as soon as possible (most often on the same day).
            </li>
            <li>'Important', but 'Not Urgent' tasks. These are the long-term goals and tasks that are important but
                don’t have a firm deadline yet. You should schedule them in a timely manner, doing the most urgent ones
                right after you’ve finished everything from the 'Do' quadrant.
            </li>
            <li>'Not Important', but 'Urgent' tasks. These tasks are the ones you can delegate to other professionals or
                appoint to complete yourself if you must, but only after your first and second quadrant tasks are
                completed.
            </li>
            <li>'Not Important' and 'Not Urgent' tasks. The tasks are placed in the 'Delete' quadrant because you should
                eliminate doing them. This may vary due to the perception of urgency and importance, but mainly these
                tasks don’t even need to be done and would be considered a complete waste of time by most people.
