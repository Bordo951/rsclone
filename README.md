# Eisenhower Planner

Eisenhower Planner is build using Babel, PostCSS and Sass with a hot dev server and an optimized production build.

### Description
This planner allows you to schedule tasks and manage your time efficiently.It is a system that basically makes you separate all your activities into four priority levels, one of which(Not Important/Not Urgent) is immediately dropped, so really itâ€™s only three categories of attention-worthy tasks to focus on.
